# Watches

## Apple Watch
Cozie should work on all Apple Watches. However, we have only tested the following devices:
 - Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS, no cellular, no longer availble)
 - Apple Watch Series 7 (GPS, no cellular, no longer availble)
 - Apple Watch Series 8 (GPS, no cellular)

Please let us know if you have used Cozie successfully on other Apple Watches.
Please, note that the watch screen size can influence how the content is rendered, i.e., strings might be broken up differently on new lines depending on the watch screen size.


## Fitbit
Fitbit's SDK has a compatiibility break. Hence, there are two versions for Cozie Fitbit.
