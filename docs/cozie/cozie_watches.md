[Please let us know](mailto:cozie.app@gmail.com) if you have used Cozie successfully on other Apple Watches.
Please, note that the watch screen size can influence how the content is rendered, i.e., strings might be broken up differently to multiple lines depending on the watch screen size.


<h2> Fitbit </h2>
Fitbit's SDK has a compatibility break. Hence, there are two versions of Cozie Fitbit.

| Watch             | SDK | Tested | Availability |
|-------------------|-----|--------|--------------|
|Fitbit Sense       | New | No     | No           |
|Fitbit Versa 3     | New | Yes    | No           |
|Fitbit Versa 2     | Old | Yes    | No           |
|Fitbit Versa Light | Old | Yes    | No           |
|Fitbit Versa       | Old | Yes    | No           |
|Fitbit Ionic       | Old | Yes    | No           |

Some of the newer Fitbit devices do not support third-party apps and hence are incompatible with Cozie Fitbit, e.g., Fitbit Versa 4 or Fitbit Sense 2.
